Stopped mid-motion in the middle
Of what we call our life, I looked up and saw no sky--
Only a dense cage of leaf, tree, and twig. I was lost.

It's difficult to describe a forest:
Savage, arduous, extreme in its extremity. I think
And the facts come back, then the fear comes back.

Death, I believe, can only be slightly more bitter.
I can't address the good I found there
Until I describe in detail what else I saw.

I don't know for certain how I entered it--
I was so sleepy-faced
At the place where I took a wrong path.

When the wooded valley I'd just passed through
In heart-rending terror
Dead-ended at the foot of a hill,

I looked up and saw the sun bright on the body
Of the hill's high spot--like a headlight
That helps the lost find the way.

The turbulent fear that had filled my heart
During the night I had passed in such sadness
Calmed some when I saw it.

Like someone breathless after an escape
From the deep end, who stands at the side of the pool
And looks back on the danger and list of close calls,

That's how I looked back--my mind a stopped top
In the middle of a turn--for a glimpse of where I'd been,
A place no one leaves alive.

I rested for a while and then started up the sandy slope.
I lifted one well-intended foot
While the lower one acted like a post.

Suddenly, at the base of a rise, just where the hill begins
Its steep incline, I saw a leopard with a patterned coat,
Light on its feet and lightning fast.

Whereever I looked it was there, blocking the path,
So that several times I turned back
And began to retrace my steps.

It was daybreak, the sun rising with the stars
That were with it when the first clock started--
The spring wound by the hand of a love supreme

Who set in motion those beautiful things.
In spite of the beast with his showy coat
I felt hope, reassured

By the fact of morning and the hint of spring,
Although the promise hollowed
When I caught sight of nothing less than a lion.

He seemed dead set against me, head high,
Crazed with hunger. It made not just me
But even the air around him tremble.

And after him: a she-wolf, her frame so emaciated
Her body seemed defined by the cravings
That had caused so many to live in misery.

Looking at her bitch-kitty face
I felt an odd sense of solid defeat and lost sight
Of any hope of climbing higher.

You've seen the one at a roulette wheel who whispers
Sweet nothing to his winnings, but when he loses whimpers,
"How did we come to this?" and wrings his hands--

I was a sad sack like that, as the impossible beast
Inch by inch drove me back into the shadows
Where the sun keeps a stopper in its mouth.

I was rushing backward into ruin when I saw someone
Who, given I'd been alone for so long,
Seemed almost a mirage.

There on that wasteland, I called out,
"Take pity on me, please, whatever you are,
Ghost or material man."  

"I was once a man." he said, "but now I'm not.
Both my parents, both Lombardi,
Were born in Mantua.

I was born late in the day of Julius Caesar
And lived in Rome, under the reign of good Augustus,
Back when the gods were false and told sweet-talking lies.

I was a poet. I sang the song of the righteous son
Of Anchises, who come back by boat from Troy
After smug Ilium had been burned to black ash.

But you, why return to what made you unhappy?
Why not climb the meringue-pie mountain ahead of you?
It's the ultimate end, and means of all pleasure."

I said, "You're Virgil, aren't you? You're the rainmaker
Who creates a torrent of speech that turns into a riptide."
Then I felt bashful and hung my head.

"The best and the brightest in the class of poets,
I read you and loved you and hope
That what I learned from you will now serve me well.

First of all authors and master of me,
I borrowed from you and to you I owe a debt
For the music that's brought me success.

Can you see the beast I had to flee? Can you save me
From her? You, Mr Ubermensch, you Mr. Man
Of the World. I'm shaking with fear."

When he saw that I was now in tears, he said,
"In that case, you have to take a different route
to escape this place that is only rock and the sandy road.

The beast that drove you back and made you cry
Ends the life of any who try
To pass here on their way through.

She's insane and insatiable. She eats more and that
Just makes her more malignant with craving. She kills
All she comes in contact with. All with whom she comes.

She takes many to her bed
And many more are coming, until the day
The big dog arrives and deals her an agonizing death.

The dog doesn't need property or money but lives
On knowledge, love and truth.
He'll be born between two layers of felt.

He'll be the savior of a now-humbled country
For which the gallant Camilla
And three loyal boys died of their wounds.


He'll search for her in this city and that, chasing the bitch
Back to the hole where Envy first undid her chain
And choker and set her loose.

As we go forward from here, it's best if you stay behind me;
I'll play the part of your guide. It's my plan
To lead you through a place neverending, ie, eternal

Hell, where you'll hear the worst kind of wailing,
See the ageless shades writhing in pain,
Sense their vain request for a second death.

After that, you'll see those who are happy in the heat
Of the fire because they hope at some point to pursue
The path to Purgatory and so achieve a Bible clerk's bliss;

To those, if that's where you would go, up and farther up,
You'll need another escort, one more honored
Than I. When I leave you, I'll leave you with her.

The Emperor on high says I can't enter His city;
I wasn't obedient to His unbendable laws. He says
I'm smudged by Adam's ink and so must live in Limbo.

He reigns in all parts of the empire. His city is there;
So is His chair, poised at the edge of Heaven.
Happy are those He asks in."

And I said to him, "Poet, I beg of you,
By the God you never knew, help me out of this Denmark,
Which threatens to go from bad to worse. Lead me

To where you just mentioned, so I can see the door
Of Purgatory and meet Saint Peter at the Gate and,
Along the way, see the dolorous souls who are designated

Damned." Then he set out, and I at his back.

## 2

So, the brownout evening and the dark air
Let go the sleepy earthly animals,
And I alone

Got ready for the combat, both with the path
And also with the weeping,
Which my uneasy memory unerringly remembers.

Muse and past intelligence, help me;
Memory that wrote everything down
In synapic ink, prove your perfect worth.

I began with, "Poet, first look through this pane of glass
That is my mind and decide whether I'm fit
Before you commit me to this difficult task."

I said, "You wrote that the father of Silvius
Went alive to Hell and with his mortal flesh
Felt the heat and cold.

I understand the rival of evil let him in--
It only makes sense since he was who he was.
And because of what was meant to happen after,

It seems right, since he knew he'd been chosen
In the highest reaches of Heaven to be the father
Of imperial Rome and her holy domination--

Which would, to abandon fiction
And turn to truth, combine together to form
The holy seat of Peter and his successors.

As you described, when he took this trip
he learned all the needed to know to conquer Turnus
And put in place the pontifical future.

Later on, God's chosen proxy, Paul, was caught up
And returned to confirm that faith
Is Step One on the way to salvation.

But why must I go there? Who says, and what army?
I'm nothing, I am nobody. Not I,
Nor any, think I'm Paul or Aeneas and suited for this.

Say I say okay, and descend, what then?
Je suis fou. I am crazy, you are not.
You must know this: what it is to doubt."

As one who revises his idea of what he wants,
Thinking, On second thought --
Then abandoning whatever he'd embarked upon--

I stood like that on that clouded-over slope,
Rumination unraveling my resolve,
Until I gave up what I'd instinctively begun.

"If I understand you,"
Said the brave shade,
"Your character's been struck by cowardice.

Not an uncommon occurrence. It makes even
The well-intended scurry like an animal
Who sees a monster in the margin of his nightmare.

I'll try to free you from your fear
By telling you why I'm here and what it was I heard
That tore my heart in two.

I was suspended with the others when a woman called me
Who was so convincing that I said
She could tell me what to do and I would do it.

Her eyes were like a star at night is bright. If angels could,
They would sing something that would sound
Like what she said:'Famous man and Mantuan,

Famous until time's whimpering end,
My friend is almost dead.
He's already on a slippery wasted slope.

A bar here, a barricade there.
He has no hope.
From what I've heard, he never faces forward;

One only sees him tracking back. Even now, as fate
Falls through its pie-shaped mesh of tick and liquid hour,
He may be too far gone. I may have come too late.

So hurry and with that way of yours with words
And with whatever else you need,
Save him and solace me.

I'm Beatrice and begging you to go. I want nothing more
Than to go back to where I came from.
Love moves me and makes me speak.

Forever after this, I'll let Him on high know
How much I owe you, how kind you've been.'
Then silence, until I said,

'Willful Woman--Because "pure of heart is to will
One thing"-- only through you can humans exceed
The limits of Heaven's little lunar circle.

I'm so happy to do what you wish that it only remains
For you to tell me what it is. Even if I'd already done it,
I would still fell I'd taken too long.

But tell me, how is it you're here in this infernal place
So far from where you love to sit and bit by bit
Piece your days together like a boundless Cornell box?'

'Since you seem sincere and so want to know,' 
She said, 'I'll say, but I'll be brief.
It's this: I am afraid of nothing in this pit.

What can hurt me here? What should I fear?
What beast can do me in that doesn't live within?
One shouldn't fear what isn't.

I'm made, by nature and nurture, and mercifully
I am who I am and thus, I don't feel
The flames of hell down here.

There's a heavenly someone, a woman so moved
By his difficulties here below, she dared to break
With judgment above and let me send you to him.

It's she who summoned Lucy and said,
"Listen, there's someone who needs you now--
And you who know no cruelty--

I'm entrusting him to your care."
Lucy looked and found me sitting
At the side of ancient Rachel.

She said, "Don't you hear him?
Don't you know he's weeping in the dark?
Don't you owe him anything

Who loved you so? Don't you see death
Threatening him with a flood
That has no vaulted ocean overhead?"

Once I heard those words I ran
As fast as one can run--Whether into the arms of good
Or away from the arms of harm--

From on high, where I was, to this rusted netherworld
To put my trust in you whose honorable words
Bring equal honor to those who listen to them.'

She spoke and when she finished
Her eyes, bright with tears, met mine;
Her weeping only made me want to act faster.

And just so, just as she wished,
I came to you on this exquisite mountain,
On the short path, and momentarily barred

The beast that blocked your way. What is this then?
Why? Why hang back? Why keep a coward
In the cupboard of your heart? Why not be bold and dare,

When up there three women in the courtyard of Heaven
Care for you. And don't you see? I am telling you
In no uncertain terms, I'm here to help you."

Like those delicate flowers that bend their closed heads
In the killing cold of night, and at daybreak look up
And see the sun, and open,

So I felt myself comeback to life
Like a man on death row to whom it's been said,
"Sorry, we made a terrible error. You're free now."

I said, "How kind she was to help me,
How gracious you were to respond so quickly
To the truth of what she told you.

You're very eloquent. After hearing you speak,
I feel eager to go on.
The initial scheme now seems feasible again.

Let's go, since we're both of one mind:
You'll be my tutor, docent, doctor."
That's what I said to him and then he moved and

I entered the dark wood, the crushing way.


## 3

WELCOME TO THE CITY OF WOE.
WELCOME TO EVERLASTING SADNESS.
WELCOME TO THE GRAVE CAVE.

JUSTICE MADE THE MAKER BUILD IT JUST LIKE THIS,
WITH PRIMITIVE LOVE AND BRICKS OF WISDOM.
IF BEING IS POWER, POWER CREATED IT, I.E., IT IS.

BEFORE THIS, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WASN'T
ETERNAL AND AFTER, NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL.
YOU, WHO HAVE NO HOPE, ENTER HERE.

These words in soot and all in caps, as if
By a hurried hand, were scrawled on the stone overhead,
Above a creaking door."Sir," I said, "this is harsh."

He spoke like an expert nephew to a drunkard uncle:
"Now you need to leave behind your fear. 
Now you need to kill your cowardice.

We're where I said we'd come to,
The place where you'd see the wretched dead
Who have lost the aid of their intellect."

He touched my hand as if to tell me all would be all right.
Then we crossed over from where we'd been
Into the inner sanctum that houses hidden things.

The starless air was echoing
With countless sighs, horrific cries,
Extended loud laments. I was in tears as I listened.

The angry accents, the strident utterances,
The striking hands, the near-deafening chorus
Of a million dolls' dark inner voices crying

"Ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma" veered off walls and swirled
Around and around, like sand in a storm
Becomes one with the wind that carries it.

And I, circled by horror, said, "Sir,
What am I hearing? Who are these people
So overcome by grief?"

He said, "This is the inheritance
Of the contemptible
Who did nothing wrong but nothing right.

They blend together with that band of vile angels
Who didn't rebel but who also didn't stand with God,
But only for themselves, in selfishness.

To preserve its beauty, Heaven threw them out.
Deepest Hell doesn't want them, since the truly wicked
Would be able to gloat, 'We're worse,

We're truly depraved.'" I asked, "What torments them?
Why do they cry so loud and so unremittingly?"
He answered: "I'll tell you quickly.

They wish to die but cannot.
Their blind lives are so empty, so without reprieve,
They envy the nothing that an ending would be.

They're not meant to be remembered.
Mercy turns her back; justice disdains them.
They're not worth our attention. Look, and then let's go."

I caught sight of a banner flitting about so restlessly
And moving forward so fast it seemed unable to take a stand.
It was followed by a sad and endless train

Of people racing after.
Never had I dreamed
Death had so many sycophants.

I saw some I recognized and then the ghost of one
Who'd stood down when faced with doing good,
And chose instead to be a coward.

I knew, incontestably, this scourage,
These despicable cowards, were the enemies
Of both Jekyll and Hyde.

They'd never lived and now would never die.
Naked as the day they were born,
Bitter wasps and hornets covered them.

Blood trickled between their tears;
This sorry sticky mixture dripped from their chins
To their feet and into the mouths of maggots.

Farther on, beyond these, I saw a crowd
Gather on the bank of a wide river.
I asked my guide, "Could you please tell me

Who these are and why they're waiting
With such eagerness to board the boat
I can barely make out in the distance?"

He told me, "Hush, it will all be clear
When we reach the bank
Of the miserable River Acheron."

I was afraid I'd annoyed him by asking,
So I stared at my feet
And stayed quiet until we reached the river.

Then, out of nowhere, there was an old man
With white hair, coming toward us in a boat,
Growling, "Give it up, you scum-uncles.

You'll never see the sky again.
Like Red Rover I'm taking you over to the other side,
Where you'll eat and drink perpetual darkness.

Your naked asses will feel the furnace and the ice.
And you, with the beating heart,
Step away from the dead." When I stood my ground

He said, "You can't get to where you're going from here.
You need the dinghy markd 'P' for Purgatory.
That one leaves from a different pier."

Virgil said, "Charon, calm down." We were standing
On the ramp. "It's been decided where decisions are made.
His passport has a stamp. Now leave it alone."

The hairy cheeks of the boatman,
King of the river rats, went slack.
His fire-eyes flared but he kept silent.

The weary and naked ones, however, went ashen,
And gritted their teeth as soon as they heard
His vicious speech. They cursed God, their parents,

The human race, the moment of their conception,
Their fathers' seed, the space between
Their mothers' legs, and the bed where they were made.

Then they moved as one, as if conjoined, sobbing
All the while, along the evil shore that awaits
Any and all who fail to fear God,

Where demon Charon, his eyes like hollow furnaces
Filled with fire, herds them together with a nod or beckons
with a bent finger, smacking the stragglers with his oar.

Fall signals the tree to drop its leaves, and it does,
One after the other, until the branch looks down
And sees a blanket on the ground;

Like that, Adam's wicked children leave the shore
One by one when summoned,
The way trained birds come when called with a tin whistle.

Then they go, over the murky water.
Before the boat has landed on the far side,
A new group is already huddled naked on the near.

"Now." said my teacher, "to your early question:
The ones you see here have died before making amends.
They come from every known country.

The reason they're so eager to cross the river
Is that the desire for divine justice prompts them;
The very thing they fear is precisely what they want.

The good never board the boat--
So if Charon curses both your shoes, and the dirt
Beneath your feet, perhaps you now know why."

At that, the pitch-dark plain shook.
Every aspect of that moment is burned into my brain:
The cold sweet inside my clothes,

The hot wind that rose off the ground wet with tears,
The massive crimson camera flash that lit the night scene
And turned us red. I lost it and dropped

Like someone seized by narcoleptic sleep.

## 4  

A deafening clap of thunder
Undermined my sleep state, startling me awake
Like someone roughly shaken.

I stood up. Feeling rested, I looked around,
Searching for a landmark
And wondering where I'd woken.

The fact is, I found myself on the brink
Of a deep and melancholy chasm
Echoing with a roar of endless anguish.

It was so dark and deep and impenetrable that
I couldn't identify anything,
However intently I tried.

"Let us go then, you and I; I'll go first, you stay behind me,"
Said the poet, who was now ghost-white.
"That's how we'll descend into the unlit world below."

Seeing how pale he was, I said, "I'm worried.
Look at you! If you're this afraid,
Who'll take care of me when I blunder and stumble?"

He shook his head.
"It's pity on my face," he said,
"For the suffering souls below, not fear.

Let's begin, since we have a long way to go."
He stepped down and motioned me to follow;
That's how we entered the first circle of the black abyss.

Here the only audible sounds were signs,
Huge heaving ones that blended together; they made
A monotonous hum that moved through the air.

They came from sad masses of men,
Woman, and children. No one seemed mistreated
But there were so many of them. The rim was teeming.

My sympathetic teacher looked at me and said,
"Don't you wonder why this group is trapped here?
Before you go any farther, I want you to know

It's not at all because they've erred;
Many in fact were good, but that's not enough.
They weren't baptized into your beliefs.

If they lived in that pre-Christian era,
They didn't worship at the right altar.
I myself was one of those.

For this and no other fault, we live here--
Where our only distress is that we remain lost
In hopeless longing."

Hearing this saddened me; I could clearly see
There were many here of great worth,
Suspended in Limbo between better and worse.

"Tell me, Teacher, I beg of you, please--"
I wanted to be reassured that unshakeable belief
Could conquer any bad beginning--

"Were there any here who, by their own
Or others' efforts on their behalf, ever found their way
To a better state of being?"

He knew What I was getting at. "I was still new
To Limbo," he said, "when I saw some lifted out
By one of the highest order, a crowned victorious force.

He took the shades of the earliest human beings:
The man who began it all, his son Abel, Noah,
Law-making Moses who was always obedient,

Patriarchal Abraham and King David, Jacob
And his clan--his fater, his children, and of course
Rachel, for whom he'd had to serve so long.

He blessed those and many more.
I have to tell you--before this,
No human soul had ever been saved."

All the while, as we were speaking,
We were cutting a path through a forest,
By which I mean a dense forest of shades.

We hadn't gone far from where I'd fainted,
When I saw a fire that shed some light
In this sphere of total darkness.

Even from this distance, I could sense
That within the circle lit by the light of the fire
Was a veritable cocktail party of eminent men.

I said, "You honor all the arts and all the sciences--
Ernest and Darwin--so who are these honorific few,
That they're divided from the others?"

He said, "Heaven is impressed with the honors
And renown that still echo on Earth;
The favored ones maintain their distinction in Limbo."

Meanwhile, a voice cut through the crowd:
"Stand aside, please, for the honored poet.
His ghost went away but now it's back."

After the voice paused and all was silent,
I watched as four important shades approached.
They were neither particularly happy, nor exactly sad.

My teacher said, "Note how the one with the Sword
Of Achilles letter opener in his hand walks in front
Of the other three. His position suggests he's their leader.

He's Homer, the reigning poet. And after him
Is Horace, the satirist. Then Ovid plays trey,
And Lucan is last.

We all share the name the voice announced:
Poet. The kindness they do
By honoring me, they gain in goodness."

I stood at the ege of the Eton of poetry,
Established by the lord of song who, eagle-like
And high above the rest, circles and glides.

They chatted some amongst themselves
Before they looked at me and motioned
To come a little closer: My teacher seemed pleased.

I was honored even more when they asked me
What I thought, and in so doing,
Made me the sixth in a world of wisdom.

We made our way like that to the limit of the light,
Discussing things that here are better left unsaid,
Just as there it was right to say them.

We came to the base of an impressive castle
That was surrounded seven times by high walls;
A little river formed a protective moat.

It was lovely The six of us walked over it
As if it were solid ground. We passed through
The seven walls and came to a spring-green meadow.

The people there were very serious; they took their time
To look around and had an air of authority.
They spoke softly, and seldom.

We moved off to one side
Where there was a well-lit open area
That was elevated--from there we could see them all. 

On the high-gloss green before me,
The most prestigious spirits were visible.
I'm still happy to have seen them.

I saw Electra, ancestress of all, with many others;
I recognized the Trojan War heroes Hector and Aeneas;
And hawk-eyed Caesar, armed to the hilt.

From the Aeneid, brave Camilla and Penthesilla;
Across from them, King Latinus
Sitting with his darling daughter, Lavinia.

I saw the Brutus who bested Tarquin the Proud.
I saw Lucretia, Cornelia, Julia, and Marcia.
And off on his own, alone, the former Sultan of Egypt.

When I tilt my head up slightly,
I could see Aristotle, the master of those who know,
seated in the middle of a philosophic family.

All look to him, all honor him.
Nearest to him and in front of all others,
I saw Socrates and Plato.

I saw Democritus, who says the world is only chance
And happenstance; then Diogenes, Anaxagoras, Thales,
Empedocles, Heraclitus, and lastly Z for Zeno.

I saw the good collector 
of good things, Dioscorides. And I saw
Orpheus, Cicero, Linus, and moral Seneca;

Geometric Euclid and Ptolemy;
As well as doctors Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen,
And Averroes, who wrote the book on Aristotle.

Of course, I'm rushing through
Because the story's still ahead. Even so
The telling could never hope to match the fact.

The group of six is then reduced to four
As my wise guide leads me by an alternate route
From the castle-calm into the troubled air outside the door.

And I come to a place where there is no daybreak, ever

## 5

I made my way down from the first circle
To the second, which has a smaller circumference
But much more misery, which makes for more tears.

Hideous Minos stands snarling at the entrance.
One by one, he interrogates each--What crime, which error, 
When the misdeed--then twists his coiled tail.

In other words, the unfortunate one before him
Confesses all and Minos, connoisseur of sin,
Renders his infallible opinion as to which

Hellish level is an exact punitive match. He then lashes
His reactive tail around himself. Each twist equals a level.
In this way he indicates how far down the soul is sent.

A many-headed multitude forever stands before him.
One by one, each steps forward: they speak, they hear,
And then they're tossed into the hollow nothingness

Where they spin until they reach the designated ring.
"Hey, you, who've come to the Hotel Woe," said Minus,
When he saw me, neglecting for a second his offical duties,

"Be careful where you go and who you talk to.
Don't be fooled by the fact that the door is always open."
"Why are you making this fuss?" my leader asked him.

"Don't you too try your best to hold him back.
It's been willed where the will is irresistible.
That's enough--just give it up."

Now the woeful notes begin to reach me.
Now I'm in a place where the sound
Of so much desperate sobbing hammers at me.

I'd arrived at the site of utter darkness; it was as if
A cyclone howled at the center of a combat
Between two warring factions, each in metal armor.

The unrelenting hellish storm
Yanks the spirits forward, jerking and whipping them.
They're unwilling victims of its violence.

When they arrive at the foot of that fallen wall
They shriek, moan, cry and curse God's power,
Using all the words that censors bleep.

I learned this special type of torments is reserved
For those whose ravenous appetite for carnal knowledge
Allowed lust to triumph over reason.

Like wings carry startlings off in crowded flocks
When the end of October hints at winter, so the wind
Carried these sinners: up, down, and at an angle,

In broad and compact masses.
What is there to comfort them? Neither more peace
Nor less pain, although they beg for both.

As cranes sing their heartbreaking songs
In a line above the rolling level, so I saw the ghosts
Come crying as they were buffeted about

By the stony cold and bitter frictions.
I asked my teacher, "Who are these people
Being thrashed about by the awful air?"

He said, "The first of the enormous group
That you see here was once the queen
Of what was once Assyria.

She legalized unlawful acts of lust
In order to indulge her own depraved desires
And nullify the blame the incest scandal caused.

Here name's Semiramis, and the books say
She succeeded here husband, Ninus,
And took her private kingdom into parts of Egypt.

The next is the one who promised to stay faithful
To the ashes of her late and loving husband,
But did not. Later, she killed herself for love.

Next is lustful Cleopatra. Over there--Helen,
Whose bad-girl behavior set in motion years
Of nonstop mayhem. There's Achilles, who

In the last battle lost to love. There's paris, Tristan..."
He went on, naming and pointing them out, one after
The other, the countless that love had caused to lose their lives.

After listening to the endless list of femmes fatales
And knights of an earlier era,
I was filled with pity, and a bit dazed.

I said to the poet, pointing, "I wish I could talk to those two
Who are locked in an embrace and seem weightless
Against this battering wind."

He said, "You'll see when they're closer;
Just say you'd like to know about the love that leads them
And they'll come right over."

The wind carried them toward us and I raised my voice:
"You two poor things, unless it's forbidden,
Could you please come by and talk to us?"

Like dove glide to a beloved dovecote--
Compelled by some strong desire,
Wings outstretched and steady on--

They came, leaving behind Dido and here kind,
Through the vicious air, drawn near
By the mere politeness with which I'd addressed them.

"You, still alive and all, you're very kind
To have braved this brutal air to visit us
After we've muddied the world with our blood.

If the Ruler of the Universe were our friend,
We'd ask him to give you peace, since you've shown us pity
In spite of our terrible wickedness.

We can tell you whatever you'd like to know
As long as the wind's calm, as it is now
And we can hear you, and you us.

I was born in Ravenna, on the Adriatic coast,
Where the Po River and its feeder streams
Peacefully drift off as they empty out to sea.

Love lit a fire in my lover's gentle heart.
He fell in love with the pretty girl I was.
I still resent the way that girl I was taken from the world.

Love, which is impossible to not return when one is loved,
Made me love him back, so that even now
We're one in Hell, as we were in the world.

Love led us to one death. But the area called Caina
Waits for the one who snuffed out our lives."
These words were carried from them to us.

When the two ruined ones were finished speaking,
I hung my head and kept it down
Until Virgil asked, "What are you thinking?"

I said, "I wonder what they were thinking--
How did they fall in love, these pretty two
Who shouldn't have, since it led them straight to this?"

I turned to them and said, "Francesca,
Your suffering makes me want to weep
In sympathy but tell me, what made you aware,

When you first began to feel some spark--
That dubious sense that even air is softly signing--
That this was love and worth perdition?"

She answered: "What's sadder than remembering
The happy past when you're feeling wretched?
Just ask your teacher; he could tell you.

Since you're so eager to know
How our young love first began, I'll tell you--
but the whole time I'm talking, I'll be in tears.

One day, to amuse ourselves, we were reading
The tales of love-struck Lancelot; we were all alone,
And naively unaware of what could happen.

More than once, while reading, we look up
And saw the other looking back. We'd blush, then pale,
Then look down again. Until a mement did us in.

We were reading about the longed-for kiss
The great lover gives his Guinevere, when that one
From whom I'll now never be parted,

Trembling, kissed my lips.
That author and his book played the part
Of Gallehault. We read no more that day."

As one ghost told the story, the other sobbed.
I so shared their sense of grief,
That I felt my senses go dim, as if dying; then,

My body fell like the dead fall down.
